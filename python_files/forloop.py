# friends = ['Long', 'Daniel', 'Ruth']
# for i in friends :
#     print("Happy New Year", i)
# print("done")


# FOR LOOP EXAMPLES
# name = "Long Maker"
# for letters in name:
#     print(letters.upper())


# for loop for a given number of elements in the list
# names = ["Long", "Brain", "Chol", "Deng"]
# for i in names:
    # print(names) # if you want to access the whole list
    # print(i)       # If you want to access each member in this list you can use i because it's an element



# Let's use range function
# range(i,j)
# i - first number
# j - last number

# for i in range(1,10): # This will print 1 - 9, the last number in range is always ignored by python
#     print(i)

# how about if you want to execute number, for example below

# for i in range(1,10,2): # this will add 2 to each and every result in a loop
#     print(i)

# Variables are also iteratable, for example
# name = "Maker"
# for i in name:
#     print(f"{i.upper()} is in {name}") # This will display every letter in Maker
